# Lower-Extremity Guided and Assisted Rehabilitation Device (LEGARD)

## Overview

The LEGARD (Lower-Extremity Guided and Assisted Rehabilitation Device) is an innovative rehabilitation tool designed to aid in post-surgical hip rehabilitation by improving hip strength and range of motion. Developed by a collaborative team of UNM physical therapy students, engineering students, and recent graduates, the LEGARD project aims to provide an effective in-home alternative to traditional rehabilitative care.


### Project Motivation

Due to barriers in accessing adequate post-surgical rehabilitative care, particularly for in-home settings, LEGARD was conceptualized and designed as a potential in-home rehabilitation device. In-home rehab care is becoming increasingly relevant, and innovations like LEGARD seek to make this experience more accessible and effective for patients.

### Prototype Development

This prototype is a collaboration between physical therapy and engineering disciplines, co-sponsored by the University of New Mexico's College of Engineering (COE) and UNM Rainforest Innovations. The device was showcased at a UNM event, highlighting advancements in orthopedic rehabilitation practices.
